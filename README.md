A café prototype that breathes, moves, and feels alive —
just like the steam rising from a cup of pahadi chai.

🌄 1. About the Prototype

This isn’t a normal UI.
Yeh ek motion-first experience hai — har screen mein halka sa animation,
soft fade-ins, card lifts, scroll par parallax, aur woh pahadi sukoon.

Inspired by:
✅ Wooden café textures
✅ Himalayan color palette
✅ Slow-life pahadi culture
✅ Modern mobile app smoothness

🎥 2. Animated Vibe & Motion Style

Prototype me har interaction kuch is tarah feel hoti hai:

🌫️ Soft Fade-In — jaise subah ke pahado me dhuan uthta hai
📱 Card Slide-Up — jaise chai ki tray table par rakhi ja rahi ho
🌿 Parallax Menu — background halka sa move hota hai
✨ Glow-on-Hover — warm café lighting jaise
🎞️ Smooth Page Transitions — cinematic, dreamy, hill-station calm

UI moves slowly, gracefully — Pahadi style.
No rush. No noise. Just chai, charm, and calm.
